We have operating systems and computer network core subjects this semester(4th) and we need to learn different types of commands and use different operating systems like Ubuntu, PintOS, etc. There are many other different Linux operating systems like centOS, MintOS, etc, and then there is Windows operating system that uses a command prompt. Now, what I learned is that different shells in different operating systems have different commands that give the exact same result. I had to google everytime I needed to check for an equivalent of a command in windows. For example, 'cd' does the exact same thing in windows command prompt that is done by 'pwd' in ubuntu's terminal i.e, it prints the location of current/working directory.

Idea is to create a universal-command which can be run on any operating system that returns the command for the given operating system the user is currently working on. If any linux user(such as myself) needs to look for a command-equivalent in any other operating system, I would just go and google it but what if I can do such simple task in the command prompt or the terminal itself? This will definitely be much more efficient and save time.
